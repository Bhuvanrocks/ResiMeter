ResiMeter: OLED-Based Resistance Measurement Device
The ResiMeter is a compact and efficient tool designed to accurately measure unknown resistances using a resistor divider circuit and an OLED display for real-time visualization. This device leverages the precision of an Arduino microcontroller to compute the resistance of an unknown resistor based on voltage readings across a known reference resistor.

The ResiMeter is equipped with:

OLED Display: Provides clear readings of the resistance in ohms, kilohms, or megaohms, along with a graphical bar that visually represents the measured value.
Resistor Divider Circuit: Ensures precise measurement by comparing the unknown resistor to a known reference resistor.
Serial Output: Displays the calculated resistance on the serial monitor for further analysis or debugging.
With its easy-to-use design, this device is ideal for electronics enthusiasts, engineers, or hobbyists who need a reliable tool for quick and accurate resistance measurements in various circuits or components.
